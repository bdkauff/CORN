		<p class="textBlock"><span id="beer">Beer</span> is an important part of many of our lives. If we think of beer's constituent parts at all, we likely think of them as being barley, hops, yeast, and water. We would be mostly right. The Reinheitsgebot, one of the earliest examples of a food purity law, was set into law in Germany in 1516. It decreed that beer must be made from, and only from, barley, hops, and water (they didn't know much about yeast yet). What many of us might not know though, is that most of the beer consumed in the world also includes rice and corn. In the US, up to 30 percent of these adjunct grains is allowed in commercial production. Adjuncts are common for a number of reasons, but they are used chiefly to make mass market beer cheaper to produce. Corn is not cheaper than barley because it is easier to grow. It is cheaper because it is heavily <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agricultural_subsidies">subsidized</a>. Why is beer made from corn problematic? It is important to understand the relationships that brewing traditions, economics, and politics all have with one another. </p>

		<p class="quoteBlock">"Eating is an agricultural act" - Wendell Berry</p>

		<p class="textBlock">The state of global agriculture today is, unfortunately, characterized by massive, chemically intensive <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monoculture">monocultures</a>, growing mostly corn and soy. But these farming operations aren't even the worst part of ag in America. There are greater systems and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neocapitalism">mechanisms</a> at work that, every day, drive us toward a grim <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/End_times">telos</a>. The tangible elements of such a system are corporate and agricultural lobbies and how they influence the federal government. We now live in an age where eating, and indeed drinking, is not just an agricultural act, but rather, a political one. Just as it is becoming popular to eat in thoughtful and responsible ways, so too should we apply to same rigor to what we drink.</p>

		<p class="textBlock">I am not saying that corn beer itself is inherenlty negative. It is worth noting that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicha">chicha</a> exists outside this paradigm. Chicha is a fermented corn beverage made in the andean regions of South America that is often made at home and with corn of a variety of types and colors. In fact, since corn itself is not to blame for our dire agricultural state, we should not forget to celebrate its place in a healthy agricultural system. Chicha, as a positive force in the corn beer conversation, may even have the unique power to invite us to reconsider our relationship with mass market beer.</p>

		 <p class="textBlock	">The corn lobby is bad, but corn isn't. Grow it in your yard with squash and beans. Grow it for decoration. Grow corn and grind it into meal for breads and tortillas. Grow colorful and rare varieties. Grow corn to make chicha and <span id="emph">drink responsibly.</span></p>
