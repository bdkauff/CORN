  <b>The aim of  SMOG/CORN </b>is to inspect a ubiquitous topic while embracing tangents, misunderstandings, analogies and <a href = "./cornshots.html">sideways modes of research</a>, ultimately creating a guided browsing that's cohesive but idiosyncratic.
  <br><br>
  As submissions for CORN began to come in, we noticed that the majority of what our contributors produced included corn in its recognizable, iconic on-the-cob form. 
  <br><br>
    <div class = "blockquote"><i>
    From the toothpaste you use in the morning to the book you read at night, corn plays a part in nearly every aspect of our lives. </i><br>-<a href = "http://corn.org">corn.org</a>
    </div>
  <br><br>
  But if corn is this iconic thing, it's also pretty obscure. The 'corn' in toothpaste, for instance, is actually <a href = "http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FSorbitol&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNGP8mbFGJMHeggZOLomQyE9o4luRg">Sorbitol</a>, 'synthesized by sorbitol-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, and converted to fructose by succinate dehydrogenase and sorbitol dehydrogenase.' Add something about PLA in 3d printers? Maybe this obscurity is why high-fructose corn syrup has become such a lightning rod in recent years: it evokes the corn we know and the corn we do not. 
  <br><br>
  <div class = "blockquote"><i>Corn...would not exist if it weren't for the humans that cultivated and developed it. It is a human invention, a plant that does not exist naturally in the wild. It can only survive if planted and protected by humans.</i></br>-<a href= "http://www.campsilos.org/mod3/students/c_history.shtml">camp silos</a></div>
  <br><br>
  In researching for CORN, we even considered trying to convince our local coffee shops to carry corn milk as a more sustainable alternative vogue dairy substitute. 
  <br><br>
  The conflict in corn is the pull between the needs of the kernel versus the needs of the cob.
  <br><br>
  Known corn, loved corn, the nostalgia-inducing grilled, hot buttered kind of corn , makes up such a narrow chapter of corn's story. The story of corn is the story of growth, of the unrelenting urge to master nature. To keep growing, expanding, getting bigger, and bigger, and bigger (and will maybe end with a real big pop ).
