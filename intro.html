    From the toothpaste you use in the morning to the book you read at night, corn plays a part in nearly every aspect of our lives. </i><br>-<a href = "http://corn.org">corn.org</a>
    </div>
  <br><br>
  Corn comes in many forms.  Toothpaste corn, for instance, is <a href = "http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FSorbitol&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNGP8mbFGJMHeggZOLomQyE9o4luRg">Sorbitol</a>, 'synthesized by sorbitol-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, and converted to fructose by succinate dehydrogenase and sorbitol dehydrogenase.' Corn comes in drywall, in diapers, and in <a href = "https://store.makerbot.com/pla-filament">3d printers</a>. 
  <br><br>
  Despite this, the majority of our submissions to CORN include corn in its most recognizable, iconic on-the-cob incarnation. This corn-- sweet, yellow, and uniform-- has an lovable immediacy. It's the corn we literally and figuratively internalize.
  <br><br>
  Corn on the cob is familiar. Corn on the cob is nostalgic. Corn on the cob is fun. It's fun to eat. It's fun to say. Corn on the cob.
  <br><br>
  <div class = "blockquote"><i>Corn...would not exist if it weren't for the humans that cultivated and developed it. It is a human invention, a plant that does not exist naturally in the wild. It can only survive if planted and protected by humans.</i></br>-<a href= "http://www.campsilos.org/mod3/students/c_history.shtml">camp silos</a></div>
  <br><br>
  After just a couple shucks corn gets complicated. Corn asks: when does growth become overgrowth? Corn is often both the problem and the solution. Corn problematizes the problem/solution model. Corn is the food for our food. Corn is even the medicine for the food for our food.  
  <br><br>
  Known corn, loved corn, the hot-buttered just-off-the-grill kind, makes up such a narrow chapter of corn's history. Corn unknown spreads in a wild control, insidiously, getting bigger, taller, will maybe end with a real big pop.
  <br><br>
  In the meantime, a corny reminder: you're a kernel on a cob, in a field of cobs, on a planet covered, knowingly or not.
