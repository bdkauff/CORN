<b><span style = "font-family:Corben"> Traveling</span></b> <span>this summer in rural France, I was surprised to find cornfields pretty much everywhere I went. &nbsp;Cornfields in Provence full of barking cicadas, cornfields in Lorraine ringed with pine trees and a few old </span><span class="c1">Front Nationale</span><span>&nbsp;posters, cornfields in the plain of Alsace all the way to the border. &nbsp;I had always thought of cornfields as distinctly American, like baseball socks or free coffee refills. &nbsp;Seeing those same yellow-tufted landscapes in a foreign country was a little uncanny. &nbsp;(This to say nothing of </span><span class="c3"><a class="c0" href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.buffalo-grill.fr%2F&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNEoeOp3OmXLM09g2VmMMndewHm4Ng">Buffalo Grill</a></span><span>, a western-themed steakhouse that seems to be a big hit in France.)</span></p><p class="c2">

<span>There&rsquo;s some basis for a patriotic response like mine &ndash; the United States is by far the world&rsquo;s largest producer and consumer of corn, and corn has been grown as a cereal crop in the Americas for thousands of years. &nbsp;But a few google searches have made it clear that the western hemisphere lost its monopoly on cornfields a long time ago. &nbsp;According to an Iowa State University web page on the &ldquo;</span><span class="c3"><a class="c0" href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fagron-www.agron.iastate.edu%2FCourses%2Fagron212%2Freadings%2Fcorn_history.htm&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNHAr2wfqm8mku1Lmc-FysfxRdgLUg">Origins, History, and Uses of Corn</a></span><span>,&rdquo; Columbus brought corn to Europe after either his first or second voyage to the new world. &nbsp;Planted first near Seville in 1494, corn soon made its way across the continent, reaching China and the Philippines within a century. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2">

<span>Late one afternoon in August, I took a picture of three statues of saints in a cornfield. &nbsp;Judging from other photos on the same roll of film, it must have been somewhere between Toulouse and Cahors, in the Lot department of southwestern France. &nbsp;They seemed incongruous, besieged behind a low fence, framed by telephone wires overhead and the asphalt of a little-traveled </span><span class="c1">route d&eacute;partementale</span><span>&nbsp;a few steps below. &nbsp;I remember thinking they must have been designed for other surroundings that fit them better, lost over the years and replaced by corn, this alien grain. &nbsp;Their encirclement seemed to typify the fate of a formerly significant monument that loses its context and stops making sense. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2"><span>But I wasn&rsquo;t quite right: the context may never have changed. &nbsp;Corn could easily have been growing in those fields long before the statues showed up. &nbsp;Corn has been a French crop since at least 1612, a corn-industry website called </span><span class="c3"><a class="c0" href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.maisculturedurable.com%2Fdossier_lhistoire_du_mais-55.html&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNHf36O3iKU92xUQQqfHazJ5pU64_w">Ma&iuml;sCultureDurable.com</a></span><span>&nbsp;tells me, when its presence is attested in a notary act for the commune of Montpont-en-Bresse in Burgundy. &nbsp;Today, according to the </span><span class="c3"><a class="c0" href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.agpm.com%2F&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNGpBKa3x8AHJD0LWwmoGjYpTtxwww">Association G&eacute;n&eacute;rale des Producteurs de Ma&iuml;s</a></span><span>&nbsp;(AGPM), France produces 18 million metric tons of corn annually and &ldquo;stands as a force confronting the American giant.&rdquo; &nbsp;This confrontation is framed as heroic but unwinnable: &ldquo;</span><span class="c1">Les Etats Unis, rois du ma&iuml;s</span><span>&rdquo; produce 41% of the world&rsquo;s corn to France&rsquo;s 3%. &nbsp;French corn farmers were initially reluctant to follow the Americans in planting higher-yield hybrids, the AGPM&rsquo;s website explains, &ldquo;but hybrids did finally prevail, as was only logical, in the 1950s.&rdquo; &nbsp;Under another heading, the site&rsquo;s authors declare ominously that &ldquo;with French regulations on GMOs, the country is now lagging behind.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span>This brings me back to the saints in the cornfield. &nbsp;If their context hasn&rsquo;t changed that much, if they were perhaps designed for that cornfield and maybe even displaced a few cornstalks when they were erected, what do they mean? &nbsp;The crowned figure in the center is probably the Virgin Mary. &nbsp;That may be Joan of Arc on the left in armor, and the bald, male figure on the right seems to be some kind of priest. &nbsp;On the Virgin&rsquo;s pedestal are the dates 1858-1908 and a Latin motto which the internet translates as &ldquo;They have made me their protector.&rdquo; &nbsp;Whom did she protect? &nbsp;Did pious landowners build these statues to bring good harvests, to show gratitude for someone&rsquo;s miraculous recovery, to discourage passers-by from helping themselves to a few ears of protected corn? &nbsp;Were these saintly bodies warding off leaf blight in the days before hybrids and pesticides? &nbsp;And why the years 1858 to 1908? &nbsp;50 years is not too short to be someone&rsquo;s lifetime &ndash; do the saints mark a grave?</span></p><p class="c2"><a name="h.gjdgxs"></a><span><img src = "steve_lance1.jpg"/></br>That day in August, running late and partly lost, I didn&rsquo;t stay long enough at the cornfield to understand the group of stone figures. &nbsp;For me it was just more corn along a highway, and another half-neglected roadside shrine. &nbsp;Now October is almost here and the corn stalks I saw will have grown taller, probably surpassing at least the armored woman and the priest, if not the virgin herself. &nbsp;In the next month the corn will be harvested and the fields left bare. &nbsp;The saints will wait out winter alone. &nbsp;I guess this rhythm can continue forever: the corn will be planted in April, harvested in October, and heavy farm machinery will hiss and scrape against the statues&rsquo; protective fencing in both seasons. &nbsp;In another hundred years perhaps a tougher, taller hybrid or GMO strain will replace the corn we recognize. &nbsp;If the highway doesn&rsquo;t get widened and force their removal, the saints will see all of this. &nbsp;They&rsquo;ll watch over these new beings, Joan with her lance and armor, the virgin with her prayers and sacred melancholy, the priest with his incantations; but they&rsquo;ll seem smaller compared to the corn, and even more alien.</span></p><img src = "steve_lance1.jpg"/>
